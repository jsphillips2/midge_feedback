\section*{Introduction}

We conducted a field mesocosm experiment to quantify 
(a) the relationship between benthic GPP and larval midge density and
(b) the relationship between adult emergence rates and larval midge density.
By combining these two relationships, we sought to evaluate the effect 
of midge ecosystem engineering on their own population dynamics.
